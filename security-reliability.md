# Web Application Security

- Session fixation attacks (pg.490)
- Require user to provide current password as part of changing their password.
    - This prevents an attacker who managed to acquire a valid session token
      from locking the legitimate user out of their account.

# Web Application Reliability

- A `Typed` interface to `Session` (pg.491)
- Idempotency of requests.
